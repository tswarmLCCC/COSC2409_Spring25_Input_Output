# COSC2409_Spring25_Input_Output

## Overview

Welcome to the COSC2409 Spring 25 Input/Output unit. This unit will cover essential concepts and techniques for handling input and output operations in Python. You will learn how to read from and write to files, format strings for better readability, and work with structured data using JSON.

## Topics Covered

### Reading and Writing Files
- **Methods of File Objects**: Learn various methods such as `read()`, `readline()`, `write()`, and `close()`.
- **Writing to a File**: Understand how to open a file in write mode and write data to it.
- **Reading from a File**: Learn how to open a file in read mode and read its content.
- **Reading Line by Line**: Discover how to read a file line by line.
- **Appending to a File**: Learn how to append data to an existing file.
- **Closing a File**: Understand the importance of closing a file explicitly.

### Saving Structured Data with JSON
- **Using the `json` Module**: Learn how to use the `json` module to save and load structured data.
- **Writing JSON Data to a File**: Understand how to serialize a Python dictionary to a JSON file.
- **Reading JSON Data from a File**: Learn how to deserialize JSON data from a file back into a Python dictionary.
- **Handling Complex Data Structures**: Work with nested dictionaries and lists in JSON format.

### Fancier Output Formatting
- **Formatted String Literals (f-strings)**: Learn how to use f-strings to embed expressions inside string literals for better readability.
- **The `format()` Method**: Understand how to use the `format()` method to format strings with placeholders.
- **Manual String Formatting**: Discover manual string formatting techniques using concatenation and other string operations.
- **Old String Formatting**: Learn the old `%` operator method for string formatting.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:
- Perform file input and output operations in Python.
- Format strings using various methods for better output readability.
- Work with JSON data for saving and loading structured information.

Happy coding!
